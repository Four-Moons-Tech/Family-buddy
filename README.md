# Family-buddy

## Description
     
* Family-buddy is a family chore organizer application. This application is for parent and children. The application helps parent motivate and manage children chores, and helps children track their progress towards the goal by completing chores and have a visualisation of the progress. 

* _What motivated us to do this project? We wanted a well designed tool to use with our family.

* _Why did I build this application?_ As a parent of 2 children, I know how challenging it can be to mitivate kids to do chores. This application helps children set a goal like a new toy and visually see where he or she is in the process of reaching theat goal. Visual presentation makes it exciting and helps a child understand that reaching a goal is not impossible. 

* _What did I learn?_  I learned how to build a SQL database, work with both front end and back end. 

* _What problem does my application solve?_ the application teaches kids how to set goals and works towards them.
